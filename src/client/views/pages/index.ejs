      <div class="content">
        <p>I focus on developing products in terms the rest of the world can understand. Whether it's on web or mobile, the satisfaction of creating unobtrusive interfaces to advanced systems is palpable. It is this act of creation that pushes me to keep working hard to develop my skills in this field.</p>
        <p>I started my career at 18 working for <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://switch.tv">Switch Media</a> in Sydney, Australia, where I had many roles including Support Engineer, DevOps, and Web Developer. This combination exposed me to all parts of the web stack and showed me the process of developing features with the customer in mind.</p>
        <p>I am now a Senior at Tufts University studying Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies. Most recently I interned with <b>Instagram</b>'s Developer Velocity team where I focused on redesigning the frontend for a webapp used by developers across the organisation. In the previous summer, I worked with the Lead Ads Product team at <b>Facebook</b>. While there, I defined a new architecture to allow for further extensibility in their Android codebase and introduced new product features across their entire platform including web, Android, and iOS.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working on mobile and web applications, I like to spend my time being active outside. You can usually find me running, hiking, or playing ultimate frisbee. I also enjoy other creative outlets including photography.</p>

      		<h3>This Website</h3>
  				<p>As a student of modern web development, its easy to choose advanced frameworks like React before tackling the basics. This website is my way of conquering the fundamentals, and is written in vanilla Javascript without any dependencies. For interested parties, the <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/wtglover/tobyglover.com">source is available</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
      		<h3>BarBud</h3>
  				<p>Native mobile application that allowed users to order drinks straight from their phone and skip the line at the busy bar. Payment was handled for the bars, meaning the user could keep having fun and wait for the push notification that their drinks were ready to get picked up!</p>
  				<p>Written fully in React Native and using Redux, BarBud was available on both iOS and Android. Because it is no longer in active development, the source for the app is <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/wtglover/barbud-app" target="_blank">available here.</a></p>

    			<p>Written during Tufts Polyhack, DejaView, was a service that allowed anyone to create private and anonymous photo albums where any user with the access code could upload and view full-resolution photos. We reached the finals during the event, producing native Android and iOS applications, a webapp, and a fully-functional backend.</p>
