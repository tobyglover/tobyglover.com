    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I focus on developing products in terms the rest of the world can understand. Whether it's on web or mobile, the satisfaction of creating unobtrusive interfaces to advanced systems is palpable. It is this act of creation that pushes me to keep working hard to develop my skills in this field.</p>

      <p>I started my career at 18 when I worked for <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://switch.tv">Switch Media</a> in Sydney, Australia, where I had many roles including Support Engineer, DevOps, and Web Developer. This combination exposed me to all parts of the web stack and showed me the process of developing product features with the customer in mind.</p>

      <p>I am now a Junior at Tufts University studying Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies. Most recently I interned with the Lead Ads Product team at <b>Facebook</b>. While there, I defined a new architecture to allow for further extensibility in their Android codebase and introduced new product features across their entire platform including web, Android, and iOS.</p>

      <p>When I'm not working on mobile and web applications, I like to spend my time being active outside. You can usually find me running, hiking, or playing ultimate frisbee. I also enjoy other creative outlets including photography.</p>
